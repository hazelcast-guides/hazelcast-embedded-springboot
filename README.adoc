= Getting Started with Hazelcast using Spring Boot

This guide will get you started to use Hazelcast in a Spring Boot application.

== Using Hazelcast in the Application

If Hazelcast is on the classpath and a suitable configuration is found, Spring Boot auto-configures a HazelcastInstance that you can inject in your application. In the `pom.xml` file, you can see Hazelcast is added as a dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast-all</artifactId>
    <version>${version.hazelcast}</version>
</dependency>
----

Hazelcast configuration (`hazelcast.yaml`) is placed under `src/main/resources/` folder. Now, we only need to auto-wire `HazelcastInstance` bean in `CommandController` and use it to access to Hazelcast data structures:

[source, java]
----
package guides.hazelcast.springboot;

import com.hazelcast.core.HazelcastInstance;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.PostMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RequestParam;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap;

@RestController
public class CommandController {
    @Autowired
    private HazelcastInstance hazelcastInstance;

    private ConcurrentMap<String,String> retrieveMap() {
        return hazelcastInstance.getMap("map");
    }

    @PostMapping("/put")
    public CommandResponse put(@RequestParam(value = "key") String key, @RequestParam(value = "value") String value) {
        retrieveMap().put(key, value);
        return new CommandResponse(value);
    }

    @GetMapping("/get")
    public CommandResponse get(@RequestParam(value = "key") String key) {
        String value = retrieveMap().get(key);
        return new CommandResponse(value);
    }
}
----

== Running the Sample Application

Run the application using Maven on a terminal:

----
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=8080"
----

Then run the application again on another terminal. But this time, note that you need to set a different value for the `server.port`.

----
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=8081"
----

After both application instances initialized, you should see the Hazelcast cluster formation in the output similar below:

----
Members {size:2, ver:2} [
	Member [192.168.1.64]:5701 - 520aec3f-58a6-4fcb-a3c7-498dcf37d8ff
	Member [192.168.1.64]:5702 - 5c03e467-d457-4847-b49a-745a335db557 this
]
----

Now, you can make calls to application endpoints to put data and get it back. Firstly, run the following command to put the data into Hazelcast distributed map:

----
curl --data "key=key1&value=hazelcast" "localhost:8080/put"
----

You will see the value in the output. Then run the command below to get the data back. Please note that the call is made to the other application instance:

----
curl "localhost:8081/get?key=key1"
----

Again, you will see the value in the output since the data is distributed among Hazelcast cluster instances and can be accessed from any of them.

== Summary

In this guide, we first developed a simple microservices application which stores the data in a Hazelcast instance. We started two application instances, and they built a Hazelcast cluster together. Since the data is shared among Hazelcast cluster instances, we can access it from both of the applications.
