:description: This tutorial will get you started with Hazelcast in a Spring Boot application.

== Use Hazelcast in the Application

If Hazelcast is on the classpath and a suitable configuration is found, Spring Boot auto-configures a `HazelcastInstance` that you can inject into your application. In the `pom.xml` file, you can see Hazelcast is added as a dependency:

[source,xml,indent=0]
----
include::ROOT:example$hazelcast-embedded-springboot/pom.xml[tag=hazelcast-dep]
----

Hazelcast configuration (`hazelcast.yaml`) is placed in the `src/main/resources/` directory. You only need to auto-wire the `HazelcastInstance` bean in the `CommandController` and use it to access to Hazelcast data structures:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::ROOT:example$hazelcast-embedded-springboot/src/main/java/guides/hazelcast/springboot/CommandController.java[]
----

== Run the Sample Application

Run the application using Maven in a terminal:

----
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=8080 --spring.profiles.active=local"
----

Then, rerun the application in another terminal.

NOTE: Notice the different value for the `server.port` argument.

----
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=8081 --spring.profiles.active=local"
----

After both application instances are initialized, you should see that the Hazelcast cluster is formed:

```bash
Members {size:2, ver:2} [
	Member [192.168.1.64]:5701 - 520aec3f-58a6-4fcb-a3c7-498dcf37d8ff
	Member [192.168.1.64]:5702 - 5c03e467-d457-4847-b49a-745a335db557 this
]
```

Now, you can issue HTTP requests to put and get data back. Run the following command to put the data into a Hazelcast distributed map:

```bash
curl --data "key=key1&value=hazelcast" "localhost:8080/put"
```

You will see the value in the output. Then run the command below to get the data back. Please note that the call is made to the other application instance:

```bash
curl "localhost:8081/get?key=key1"
```

Again, you will see the value in the output since the data is distributed among Hazelcast cluster instances and can be accessed from any of them.

== Test the Application

To run the integration tests, run the following command in terminal. But before, make sure to kill the running application instances.

----
mvn verify -Ptests
----

If the tests pass, you’ll see a similar output to the following:

----
[INFO] Results:
[INFO]
[INFO] Tests run: 3, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
[INFO]
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
----

== Summary

In this guide, you developed a simple Spring Boot application that stores the data in a Hazelcast member. You started two application instances, and they formed a Hazelcast cluster. You pushed data to an application instance, and since the data was shared among Hazelcast cluster members, you could access it from both application instances.
